Release version: 0.0.2-beta
------------------------------------------------------------------------
* Some sounds play at their maximum volume irrespective of the sound volume control.
* Sandbox mode does not support all map modifications.
* Zero clearance cheat results in drawing glitches.
* Build while paused mode does not support all game commands.
* Some text shown in the map is not translated to selected language.
* Scenario editor object selection window will show object names in the selected language at the time of building the object cache. (Deleting plugin.dat in Documents/OpenRCT2 will fix this)
* The game will run slower at high resolutions, particularly if there are many moving objects visible.

Most bugs or limitations present in the original game have not yet been fixed or lifted.
